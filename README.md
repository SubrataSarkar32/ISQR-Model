# ISQR-Model
Implementation of ISQR model and its simulation

In this file we have shown the implementation of ISQR algorithm using Python Google Colab. in this file images are stored in google drive and the output are also stored in different directory of google drive. In this code we mainly focus on encoding pixel states instead of creating image matrix. The image matrix we thought of has already been created using several unitary gates. 


# Datasets

Coal Mines images dataset have been taken from internet and respective output is also shown 

ExDark Dataset have been taken from Github repository (https://github.com/cs-chan/Exclusively-Dark-Image-Dataset)(https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cviu.2018.10.010)
